1,my name is Camilo.,I have two cats.,They are called Meme and Lola.
2,They are both very cute.,though they can be a handful.,They are very wild.
3,Lola likes to play a lot and scratch my couch.,Meme likes to eat all of my food.,It's a terrible thing!
4,But both of them like to snuggle a lot.,Which is why I can't get upset with them.,And I forgive them everything.
